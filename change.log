July 2023 - Version 9.02
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Originator: Jeremy Knittel, jeremy.knittel@lasp.colorado.edu
Alterations:
1. Added University of Colorado copyright to all source code
2. Added IPOPT interface
3. Modified all code to use base NLP class instead of directly 
calling SNOPT class except upon initialization when user 
requests SNOPT
4. Added NOIPOPT and NOSNOPT compiler flags to allow compiling 
EMTG without one or the other
5. Added LASP logo and had PyEMTG use it
6. Override the left boundary on phase flight time because it 
causes lots of problems to try and be smart about it.
